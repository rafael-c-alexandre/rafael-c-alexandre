### Hi visitor, my name is Rafael (he/him) 👋,

I am an early-stage researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/) 💻, currently studying the problem of the interruption and subsequent restart of a serverless instance, specifically when functions are not idempotent. I also recently obtained an MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) 🎓.

My main interests are within the fields of **Distributed Systems** and **Cybersecurity** 🧐. I am also trying to get into the **machine learning** realm 🤖 and some of my current personal projects follow that interest.
