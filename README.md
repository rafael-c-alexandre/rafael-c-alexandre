### Hi visitor, my name is Rafael (he/him) 👋,

💻 I am an early-stage researcher at <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank">INESC-ID</a>, currently studying the problem of the interruption and subsequent restart of a serverless instance, specifically when functions are not idempotent. <br>
🎓I also recently obtained an MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a>.

🧐 My main interests are within the fields of **Distributed Systems** and **Cybersecurity** . <br>
🤖 I am also trying to get into the **machine learning** realm and some of my current personal projects follow that interest.
