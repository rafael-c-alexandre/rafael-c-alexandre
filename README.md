### ðŸ‘‹ Hi visitor, my name is Rafael (he/him)


ðŸ’» I am a software engineer at [ING](https://www.ing.nl/particulier). Previously, I was a researcher at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl), working on the optimization of federated learning offloading algorithms and, before that, an early-stage researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), studying the problem of the interruption and subsequent restart of a serverless instance, specifically when functions are not idempotent. <br>
ðŸŽ“I also recently obtained an MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).
